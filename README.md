## The Odin on Rails HTML/CSS [Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
This project is meant to demonstrate basic and intermediate knowledge of the HTML and CSS languages. The objective is to make a simple look-alike clone of Google's homepage.

### Reflections
Originally, I attempted to perform this exercise using CSS grids for placement of the horizontal navbars on the top and bottom; I quickly found that this was not a good design choice, and later migrated to using flex placements instead, which proved much simpler, especially when attempting to center/align elements. This decision ended up leading to a somewhat responsive design.

As this exercise was only intended for practice in mimicking the *look* of the Google page, no time was spent providing any scripting or other actions that you would expect with Google's actual page.
